## Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive review of the smart contract code for **Pancake Prediction V3**. The review aims to assess the contract’s quality, security, efficiency, and adherence to best practices to ensure its reliability and robustness.


## Overview of the Contract
The `PancakePredictionV3` contract is a prediction market contract built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to place bets on predictions, with the outcomes determined by an oracle. This contract includes various utilities to manage the betting rounds, calculate rewards, and handle treasury fees.

### License
- SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

### Pragma Version
- Solidity ^0.8.0 with ABI coder v2 enabled.

## Imports
The contract imports several dependencies:
- `Ownable`: Access control module for ownership-related functions.
- `Pausable`: Allows the contract to be paused and unpaused, providing emergency stop functionality.
- `ReentrancyGuard`: Guards against reentrancy attacks.
- `IERC20`: Interface for the ERC20 token standard, used here for handling token interactions.
- `SafeERC20`: Safe wrappers around ERC20 operations to prevent issues on ERC20 contracts with different implementations.
- `AggregatorV3Interface`: Interface for Chainlink’s price feed oracles to obtain real-time price data.

## Contract Definition and Inherited Contracts
The `PancakePredictionV3` contract inherits from:
- `Ownable`: Gives control over the contract to a specific owner.
- `Pausable`: Provides mechanisms to pause and unpause contract operations.
- `ReentrancyGuard`: Protects functions from being called more than once in the same transaction, avoiding reentrancy attacks.

## State Variables
- **token**: (`IERC20`) - The ERC20 token used for placing bets.
- **oracle**: (`AggregatorV3Interface`) - Chainlink oracle for price data.
- **genesisLockOnce**: (`bool`) - Flag to ensure genesis lock can only happen once.
- **genesisStartOnce**: (`bool`) - Flag to ensure genesis start can only happen once.
- **adminAddress**: (`address`) - Address of the contract admin.
- **operatorAddress**: (`address`) - Address of the contract operator.
- **bufferSeconds**: (`uint256`) - Allowed buffer time in seconds for round resolution.
- **intervalSeconds**: (`uint256`) - Time interval in seconds between rounds.
- **minBetAmount**: (`uint256`) - Minimum betting amount in wei.
- **treasuryFee**: (`uint256`) - Fee rate for the treasury (e.g., 200 = 2%).
- **treasuryAmount**: (`uint256`) - Accumulated treasury amount that is not yet claimed.
- **currentEpoch**: (`uint256`) - Current epoch for the betting round.
- **oracleLatestRoundId**: (`uint256`) - Latest round ID from the oracle, converted from `uint80`.
- **oracleUpdateAllowance**: (`uint256`) - Maximum allowed seconds between oracle updates.
- **MAX_TREASURY_FEE**: (`uint256`, constant) - Maximum allowable treasury fee (10%).

### Mappings
- **ledger**: (`mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => BetInfo))`) - Ledger of all bets placed, indexed by epoch and user address.
- **rounds**: (`mapping(uint256 => Round)`) - Stores information about each prediction round.
- **userRounds**: (`mapping(address => uint256[])`) - Tracks which rounds a user has participated in.

### Enums and Structs

Allows users to claim their rewards for specific epochs.

- **Parameters**:
  - `epochs`: An array of epoch IDs for which the user wants to claim rewards.

**Requirements**:
- Each specified round must have started and ended.
- If the oracle was called, the user must be eligible for a claim; otherwise, they must be eligible for a refund.

### `executeRound`
Executes the current round by finalizing the previous round and starting the next one.

**Requirements**:
- The function can only be executed after both the genesis start and lock functions have been called.

```solidity
function executeRound() external whenNotPaused onlyOperator {
    require(
        genesisStartOnce && genesisLockOnce,
        "Can only run after genesisStartRound and genesisLockRound is triggered"
    );

    (uint80 currentRoundId, int256 currentPrice) = _getPriceFromOracle();

    oracleLatestRoundId = uint256(currentRoundId);

    // CurrentEpoch refers to previous round (n-1)
    _safeLockRound(currentEpoch, currentRoundId, currentPrice);
    _safeEndRound(currentEpoch - 1, currentRoundId, currentPrice);
    _calculateRewards(currentEpoch - 1);

    // Increment currentEpoch to current round (n)
    currentEpoch = currentEpoch + 1;
    _safeStartRound(currentEpoch);
}
```

---

### `genesisLockRound`
Locks the genesis round to finalize betting and prepare for the next round.

**Requirements**:
- This function can only be executed by the operator.
- It can only be called after the genesis start round has been triggered and can only be run once.

function genesisLockRound() external whenNotPaused onlyOperator {
    require(genesisStartOnce, "Can only run after genesisStartRound is triggered");
    require(!genesisLockOnce, "Can only run genesisLockRound once");

    (uint80 currentRoundId, int256 currentPrice) = _getPriceFromOracle();

    oracleLatestRoundId = uint256(currentRoundId);

    _safeLockRound(currentEpoch, currentRoundId, currentPrice);

    currentEpoch = currentEpoch + 1;
    _startRound(currentEpoch);
    genesisLockOnce = true;
}
```

### **genesisStartRound**
This function initiates the genesis round, allowing the operator to start the first betting round.
- **Requirements**:
  - `genesisStartOnce` must be `false` to prevent multiple initiations.
  
```solidity
function genesisStartRound() external whenNotPaused onlyOperator {
    require(!genesisStartOnce, "Can only run genesisStartRound once");

    currentEpoch = currentEpoch + 1;
    _startRound(currentEpoch);
    genesisStartOnce = true;
}
```

### **pause**
This function pauses the contract, preventing all non-admin actions. It's callable by the admin or operator.
- **Effects**:
  - Triggers a stopped state, emitting a `Pause` event with the current epoch.
  
```solidity
function pause() external whenNotPaused onlyAdminOrOperator {
    _pause();

    emit Pause(currentEpoch);
}
```

### **claimTreasury**
Admin can claim all accumulated rewards in the treasury. It ensures that the treasury amount is transferred to the admin.
- **Non-reentrancy**: It uses `nonReentrant` to prevent re-entrancy attacks during the transfer.
  
```solidity
function claimTreasury() external nonReentrant onlyAdmin {
    uint256 currentTreasuryAmount = treasuryAmount;
    treasuryAmount = 0;
    token.safeTransfer(adminAddress, currentTreasuryAmount);
    emit TreasuryClaim(currentTreasuryAmount);
}
```

### **unpause**
This function allows the admin to resume normal operations after a pause, resetting the genesis state.
- **Requirements**:
  - Only callable when the contract is paused.
  
```solidity
function unpause() external whenPaused onlyAdminOrOperator {
    genesisStartOnce = false;
    genesisLockOnce = false;
    _unpause();

    emit Unpause(currentEpoch);
}
```

### **setBufferAndIntervalSeconds**
The admin can set the buffer and interval times for betting rounds. This function ensures the buffer is less than the interval.
- **Requirements**:
  - Only callable when the contract is paused.
  
```solidity
function setBufferAndIntervalSeconds(uint256 _bufferSeconds, uint256 _intervalSeconds)
    external
    whenPaused
    onlyAdmin
{
    require(_bufferSeconds < _intervalSeconds, "bufferSeconds must be inferior to intervalSeconds");
    bufferSeconds = _bufferSeconds;
    intervalSeconds = _intervalSeconds;

    emit NewBufferAndIntervalSeconds(_bufferSeconds, _intervalSeconds);
}
```

### **setMinBetAmount**
This function allows the admin to update the minimum bet amount.
- **Requirements**:
  - Must not set `_minBetAmount` to zero.
  
```solidity
function setMinBetAmount(uint256 _minBetAmount) external whenPaused onlyAdmin {
    require(_minBetAmount != 0, "Must be superior to 0");
    minBetAmount = _minBetAmount;

    emit NewMinBetAmount(currentEpoch, minBetAmount);
}
```

### **setOperator**
Admin can change the operator's address. It ensures the new address is not zero.
- **Requirements**:
  - The `_operatorAddress` must not be a zero address.
  
```solidity
function setOperator(address _operatorAddress) external onlyAdmin {
    require(_operatorAddress != address(0), "Cannot be zero address");
    operatorAddress = _operatorAddress;

    emit NewOperatorAddress(_operatorAddress);
}
```

### **setOracle**
This function updates the oracle address used for price data. It also checks if the new oracle implements the expected interface.
- **Requirements**:
  - The new oracle address must not be zero.
  
```solidity
function setOracle(address _oracle) external whenPaused onlyAdmin {
    require(_oracle != address(0), "Cannot be zero address");
    oracleLatestRoundId = 0;
    oracle = AggregatorV3Interface(_oracle);

    // Dummy check to make sure the interface implements this function properly
    oracle.latestRoundData();

    emit NewOracle(_oracle);
}
```

### **setOracleUpdateAllowance**
Admin can set the allowance for oracle data freshness.
- **Requirements**:
  - Callable only when the contract is paused.
  
```solidity
function setOracleUpdateAllowance(uint256 _oracleUpdateAllowance) external whenPaused onlyAdmin {
    oracleUpdateAllowance = _oracleUpdateAllowance;

    emit NewOracleUpdateAllowance(_oracleUpdateAllowance);
}
```

### **setTreasuryFee**
This function allows the admin to adjust the treasury fee while ensuring it does not exceed the maximum allowed fee.
- **Requirements**:
  - The new treasury fee must be less than or equal to `MAX_TREASURY_FEE`.
  
```solidity
function setTreasuryFee(uint256 _treasuryFee) external whenPaused onlyAdmin {
    require(_treasuryFee <= MAX_TREASURY_FEE, "Treasury fee too high");
    treasuryFee = _treasuryFee;

    emit NewTreasuryFee(currentEpoch, treasuryFee);
}
```

### **recoverToken**
This function allows the contract owner to recover tokens that were mistakenly sent to the contract, excluding the prediction token.
- **Requirements**:
  - The `_token` parameter must not be the same as the contract's primary prediction token.
  
```solidity
function recoverToken(address _token, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(_token != address(token), "Cannot be prediction token address");
    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(address(msg.sender), _amount);

    emit TokenRecovery(_token, _amount);
}
```

### **setAdmin**
This function enables the owner to update the admin address, ensuring that the new address is valid (non-zero).
- **Requirements**:
  - The `_adminAddress` parameter must not be zero.
  
```solidity
function setAdmin(address _adminAddress) external onlyOwner {
    require(_adminAddress != address(0), "Cannot be zero address");
    adminAddress = _adminAddress;

    emit NewAdminAddress(_adminAddress);
}
```

### **getUserRounds**
This function retrieves the round epochs and betting information for a specific user based on a cursor and size. It is designed to be a paginated view for user-specific data.
- **Parameters**:
  - `user`: The address of the user.
  - `cursor`: The starting point for fetching data.
  - `size`: The number of records to fetch.
  
```solidity
function getUserRounds(
    address user,
    uint256 cursor,
    uint256 size
)
    external
    view
    returns (
        uint256[] memory,
        BetInfo[] memory,
        uint256
    )
{
    uint256 length = size;

    if (length > userRounds[user].length - cursor) {
        length = userRounds[user].length - cursor;
    }

    uint256[] memory values = new uint256[](length);
    BetInfo[] memory betInfo = new BetInfo[](length);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        values[i] = userRounds[user][cursor + i];
        betInfo[i] = ledger[values[i]][user];
    }

    return (values, betInfo, cursor + length);
}
```

### **getUserRoundsLength**
This function returns the total number of rounds a user has participated in.
- **Parameters**:
  - `user`: The address of the user for whom the rounds are queried.
  
```solidity
function getUserRoundsLength(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
    return userRounds[user].length;
}
```

### **claimable**
This function checks if a user can claim their rewards for a specific epoch based on their bet information and the round's state.
- **Logic**:
  - It verifies that the `lockPrice` and `closePrice` are not equal and checks the conditions for a successful claim based on the user's position.
  
```solidity
function claimable(uint256 epoch, address user) public view returns (bool) {
    BetInfo memory betInfo = ledger[epoch][user];
    Round memory round = rounds[epoch];
    if (round.lockPrice == round.closePrice) {
        return false;
    }
    return
        round.oracleCalled &&
        betInfo.amount != 0 &&
        !betInfo.claimed &&
        ((round.closePrice > round.lockPrice && betInfo.position == Position.Bull) ||
            (round.closePrice < round.lockPrice && betInfo.position == Position.Bear));
}
```

### **refundable**
This function checks if a user can refund their bet for a specific epoch based on the round's state and the user's bet information.
- **Logic**:
  - It checks that the oracle has not been called, the bet has not been claimed, the close timestamp has passed, and the user has a non-zero bet amount.
  
```solidity
function refundable(uint256 epoch, address user) public view returns (bool) {
    BetInfo memory betInfo = ledger[epoch][user];
    Round memory round = rounds[epoch];
    return
        !round.oracleCalled &&

        betInfo.amount != 0;
}
```

## Internal Functions

### `_calculateRewards`
This function calculates rewards for a specific round based on the outcome of the betting.

    Round storage round = rounds[epoch];
    uint256 rewardBaseCalAmount;
    uint256 treasuryAmt;
    uint256 rewardAmount;

    // Bull wins
    if (round.closePrice > round.lockPrice) {
        rewardBaseCalAmount = round.bullAmount;
        treasuryAmt = (round.totalAmount * treasuryFee) / 10000;
        rewardAmount = round.totalAmount - treasuryAmt;
    }
    // Bear wins
    else if (round.closePrice < round.lockPrice) {
        rewardBaseCalAmount = round.bearAmount;
        treasuryAmt = (round.totalAmount * treasuryFee) / 10000;
        rewardAmount = round.totalAmount - treasuryAmt;
    }
    // House wins
    else {
        rewardBaseCalAmount = 0;
        rewardAmount = 0;
        treasuryAmt = round.totalAmount;
    }
    round.rewardBaseCalAmount = rewardBaseCalAmount;
    round.rewardAmount = rewardAmount;

    // Add to treasury
    treasuryAmount += treasuryAmt;

    emit RewardsCalculated(epoch, rewardBaseCalAmount, rewardAmount, treasuryAmt);
}
```

### `_safeEndRound`
This function safely ends a round after it has locked and checks the current timestamp against the round's close timestamp.

function _safeLockRound(
    uint256 epoch,
    uint256 roundId,
    int256 price
) internal {
    require(rounds[epoch].startTimestamp != 0, "Can only lock round after round has started");
    require(block.timestamp >= rounds[epoch].lockTimestamp, "Can only lock round after lockTimestamp");
    require(
        block.timestamp <= rounds[epoch].lockTimestamp + bufferSeconds,
        "Can only lock round within bufferSeconds"
    );
    Round storage round = rounds[epoch];
    round.closeTimestamp = block.timestamp + intervalSeconds;
    round.lockPrice = price;
    round.lockOracleId = roundId;

    emit LockRound(epoch, roundId, round.lockPrice);
}
```

### `_safeStartRound`
This function safely starts a new round, ensuring that the previous round (n-2) has ended before starting.

```solidity
function _safeStartRound(uint256 epoch) internal {
    require(genesisStartOnce, "Can only run after genesisStartRound is triggered");
    require(rounds[epoch - 2].closeTimestamp != 0, "Can only start round after round n-2 has ended");
    require(
        block.timestamp >= rounds[epoch - 2].closeTimestamp,
        "Can only start new round after round n-2 closeTimestamp"
    );
    _startRound(epoch);
}
```

### `_startRound`
This function initializes a new round, setting timestamps and initial parameters.

```solidity
function _startRound(uint256 epoch) internal {
    Round storage round = rounds[epoch];
    round.startTimestamp = block.timestamp;

    round.epoch = epoch;
    round.totalAmount = 0;

    emit StartRound(epoch);
}
```

### `_bettable`
This function checks if a round is valid for placing bets based on its state and the current timestamp.

```solidity
function _bettable(uint256 epoch) internal view returns (bool) {
    return
        rounds[epoch].startTimestamp != 0 &&
        rounds[epoch].lockTimestamp != 0 &&
        block.timestamp > rounds[epoch].startTimestamp &&
        block.timestamp < rounds[epoch].lockTimestamp;
}
```

### `_getPriceFromOracle`
This function retrieves the latest price from the oracle, ensuring it is within the allowed update window.

```solidity
function _getPriceFromOracle() internal view returns (uint80, int256) {
    uint256 leastAllowedTimestamp = block.timestamp + oracleUpdateAllowance;
    (uint80 roundId, int256 price, , uint256 timestamp, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
    require(timestamp <= leastAllowedTimestamp, "Oracle update exceeded max timestamp allowance");
    require(
        uint256(roundId) > oracleLatestRoundId,
        "Oracle update roundId must be larger than oracleLatestRoundId"
    );
    return (roundId, price);
}
```

### `_isContract`
This function checks whether an address is a contract or an externally owned account (EOA).

```solidity
function _isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(account)
    }
    return size > 0;
}
```

## Review Objectives

- **Code Quality**: Assess readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Security**: Identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure robust security measures.
- **Functionality**: Verify that all intended features are correctly implemented and function as expected.
- **Performance**: Evaluate gas efficiency and overall performance of the contract.
- **Best Practices**: Ensure the contract follows Solidity and blockchain development best practices.
- **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings.

## Detailed Analysis

### Contract Logic & Design Patterns
- **Core Logic**: The primary functionalities are implemented correctly with clear logic.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes the **Ownable** pattern for access control and **ReentrancyGuard** to prevent reentrancy attacks.

### Code Structure & Organization
- The code is generally well-structured, with clear function definitions and appropriate use of data structures (e.g., mappings and structs).
- Comments are provided, but additional documentation for complex logic would help other developers understand the intent behind specific implementations.

### Contract Logic & Design Patterns
- The contract uses a straightforward approach to manage betting rounds and interactions with the oracle.
- State management is effectively handled with appropriate checks in each function.
- Design patterns like the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern are partially followed but should be reinforced in certain functions to enhance security (e.g., during state changes before external calls). 

## Summary of Findings
- **Functionality**: The contract effectively implements betting logic, round lifecycle management, and interaction with oracles.
- **Security**: Potential vulnerabilities were identified, improper input validation.
- **Efficiency**: Certain functions can be optimized for gas savings and performance.
- **Code Clarity**: The organization of code sections could improve readability and maintainability.

### Security Considerations
<!-- 
- **Reentrancy Risks**: While the contract does not directly manage funds in its current state, any future modifications should consider reentrancy protection mechanisms such as using `checks-effects-interactions`. -->
- **Input Validation**: Some functions could benefit from more rigorous input validation to prevent erroneous states (e.g., checking for valid prices and timestamps).
- **Oracle Dependency**: Ensure that the oracle's behavior is reliable and that the contract can handle cases where the oracle fails to respond or provides faulty data.

### Efficiency & Performance

- Some internal calculations could be optimized for gas efficiency, especially those that are called frequently or in loops.
- Consider the gas costs associated with complex computations in frequently called functions and evaluate if any caching mechanisms can be implemented.

### Event Emission

- The contract uses event emissions effectively to notify external parties of state changes.
- Ensure that all critical actions, especially those modifying state, are accompanied by appropriate event emissions for transparency.

## Recommendations
- 

## Conclusion

Overall, the **Pancake Prediction V3** smart contract presents a well-thought-out design for managing a betting system. However, improvements in security practices, efficiency, and code organization are recommended to enhance its robustness and maintainability. By addressing the identified issues and implementing the recommendations, the contract can be better positioned for secure and efficient operation.
